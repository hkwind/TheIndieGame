    # rogue characteristics: bring a team into the dungeon(?), fight and explore for treasure, bring back to the colony if win through the whole
    # progressive improvement in terms of technology (weapon, defensive item, utility item, relic)
    
    # combat feature (darkest dungeon like?, minion waves, elite boss for every adventure/run)
    # roll dice implementation (in combat, research, relic use)
    # cruel combat (non linear route, can choose easy/challenging route, can change difficulty of battle during in camp/not)
    # data, might be in combat, not showing
    
    # thorough customization on starting character based on some fixed choice (personality, capability), new will be unlocked through gameplay
    # colony making (base building, improve quality of life, research advancement); base raids occurs regularly
    # extra boss-specific ability/item to obtain only in special way
